# Simon-Game

This is a take on the game Simon.
This is a kind of a memory game where the player must remember the sequence of the colors which are being given out by the computer and the player must select the colors as per the pattern shown.
If the player is unable to remeber the pattern and picks a wrong sequence the player looses the game.
